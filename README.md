# CodeAlpha_Project_Management_Tools

This **Project Management System** was developed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The system aims to optimize team collaboration and task management by providing an intuitive platform where teams can organize, track, and execute their projects in real-time. It blends the essentials of a structured project management tool with a user-friendly, interactive environment.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Secure User Authentication 🔐**  
  The system ensures robust security through encrypted login and registration processes. This guarantees the privacy of user data and ensures that only authorized users can access project-related information, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of the platform.

- **Group Creation & Admin Control 🏗️**  
  Any user can create a group, becoming the admin of that group. As the admin, the user has full control to manage the group, including adding or removing members, assigning tasks, and overseeing all activities within the group. This feature is essential for smooth team collaboration and task execution.

- **Member Visibility & Management 👥**  
  Admins have complete visibility of all members within the group, helping them effectively manage roles and responsibilities. This transparency ensures that each team member is aware of their responsibilities, streamlining project execution.

- **Task Assignment & Progress Tracking 📝**  
  Admins can assign tasks with detailed descriptions and deadlines to group members. Each task is tracked in the "My Task" section, allowing users to update their task status (In Progress or Completed). This feature ensures efficient task management and provides transparency in task progress.

- **Task Assignment Transparency 🔍**  
  The system displays clear information about who is responsible for each task, ensuring that every team member knows who is handling which task. This promotes accountability and reduces the likelihood of missed or delayed tasks.

- **Real-Time Task Comments & Collaboration 💬**  
  Team members can comment on tasks, enabling real-time feedback, discussions, and updates. This feature fosters collaboration, keeping everyone aligned on the status and requirements of tasks.

- **Profile Management 👤**  
  Users can personalize their profiles, view their task history, track progress, and stay updated on their completed and pending tasks. This ensures that users remain engaged and organized throughout the project lifecycle.

  The frontend is designed to be responsive and interactive, providing a seamless user experience across devices.

- **Backend:** PHP  
  The backend leverages PHP to handle user authentication, task assignment, and communication between the frontend and database.

- **Database:** MySQL  
  The database is used to store user data, group information, tasks, and other necessary project details. MySQL ensures fast data retrieval and secure storage.

This technology stack enables the platform to deliver a responsive, dynamic, and scalable solution capable of supporting real-time task management and team collaboration.
